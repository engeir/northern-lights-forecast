"""Check the web for signs of northern lights.

This script implements an automated Northern Lights forecast
by taking advantage of web scraping of the web site of the IMAGE Magnetometer.
At a given threshold of the derivative of the X component,
a notification is sent to let the user know a substorm has occurred.

The script is run every hour from 18:00 through 04:00 during
the months September through March, using crontab to automate the task.
To edit the crontab script, type
```sh
env EDITOR=nano crontab -e
```
into the terminal.
